# Introduction  
These recipes are a collection from various places around the Internet. Together they from the body of a challenge I undertook in 2020/2021 called the “Twelve Treats of Christmas”. The intention was to try making twelve different Christmas food items so as to experience new things and try new skills.

Use at your own risk.
