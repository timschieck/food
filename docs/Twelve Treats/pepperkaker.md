## Ingredients
Amount | Ingredient
--- | ---
400g | (2 cups) sugar
200g | (3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) butter
80ml | (1/3 cup) light syrup
160ml | (2/3 cup) heavy cream
1 TB | cognac (optional)
4 tsp | ginger
4 tsp | cinnamon
2 tsp | black pepper
4 tsp | cloves, crushed 
1 TB | baking soda
750-850g | (6 -7 cups) flour

## Method
1. In a large saucepan, add the sugar, butter and syrup. Stir together and heat until melted. Set aside to cool.
2. Once the mixture has cooled down a bit, stir in the heavy cream and cognac, if using. Add the spices, baking soda and a little flour at a time to the mixture. Check the dough just before you have added 750g/6 cups flour. You want a smooth and relatively firm dough, so you may not use all of the flour.
3. Take the dough out of the pan, cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours, preferably overnight.
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Allow the dough to stand at room temperature for a little while before rolling out the dough.
5. Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 350°F.
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out pieces of the dough to a thickness of about 0.5 cm (even slightly less) and cut into shapes as desired. Place on a prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake in the center of the oven for about 10-12 minutes. You want the edges to brown a little and crisp up. Cool on a wire rack.
8. You can decorate the pepperkaker with icing or powdered sugar or anything else your heart desires. Store in cookie tins and enjoy!
