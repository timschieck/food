## Ingredients
Amount | Ingredient
--- | ---
2 tsp | butter
3/4 cup | granulated sugar
1/4 cup | water
1 tsp | vanilla extract
2 tsp | cinnamon
2 cups | whole almonds

## Method
1. Roast almonds in oven at 325 for 15-20 minutes.
2. Line a large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Grease the baking mat/parchment paper with butter.
3. In a nonstick pan, combine sugar, water, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
4. Add almonds. Cook and stir the mixture until the water has evaporated. It will change from liquid to syrup to a stringy consistency and then crystalize onto the almonds. Be sure to stir consistently throughout.
5. Pour the almonds onto the prepared baking sheet and separate them with forks or a spatula. Let cool for about 15 minutes.
6. Store almonds in an airtight container.
